🌤️ Weather App
A simple and interactive weather app that shows real-time weather and changes the background image based on the current weather condition.

Just enter a city or use your current location — and the app will:
>Fetch live weather data using WeatherAPI
>Change the background (sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.)
>Display temperature and condition clearly

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's clean, responsive, and easy to use.
Great for anyone who wants quick weather info — with a visual feel.
